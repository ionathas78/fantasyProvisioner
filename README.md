This program is a fun little project I did for class. Its primary purpose was making change based on USD currency, so I converted D&D's typical gp economy to dollars, spread out the prices a bit to make it more fun, and gave it a bit of skew for replayability's sake.
Right now it's very simple and straightforward. It might be nice in the future to merge like items in inventory instead of having a separate line item for each purchase. It would also be nice to have cycling inventory, where the store chooses a selection of a larger product list that it has in stock, also to improve playability. I'd love to incoporate a haggling algorithm, too, to crown it off--similar to that in the old Moria roguelike, but we'll see.


## User Story

```
AS A Tabletop RPG player and programmer
I WANT to write a Python program to simulate a general store
SO THAT I can get my roleplay on while I have fun working in Python
```

```
GIVEN THAT the user has an inventory and cash
WHEN I start the program
THEN I want to see the goods the store has to offer
WHEN I purchase something
THEN I can buy more than one item
WHEN I pay for the item
THEN I have the cash deducted from my purse
WHEN I receive the item
THEN I can see my inventory and its total weight
```
